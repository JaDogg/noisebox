#### How do I customize the audio mix?
* Add any audio loops/cuts to `noise` folder.
* Edit `mix.json`
* If you want to make your own loops see [this](https://gamedevbeginner.com/create-looping-sound-effects-for-games-for-free-with-audacity/).
* You can also fork the repo and install from that and then edit `mix.json` (so you can save it to github).

rem this uses build.cmd
build
